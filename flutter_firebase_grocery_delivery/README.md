# ðŸ›’ Flutter Grocery Delivery App

A complete, cross-platform mobile application for grocery ordering and delivery, built with Flutter and backed by Firebase. This project serves as a focused learning sandbox to master core Flutter concepts, state management, complex UI layouts, asynchronous data handling with Firestore, and effective project architecture.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

This project is specifically designed to master the following core Flutter and architecture concepts:

- **Project Architecture**: Understanding folder organization (`lib/screens/`, `lib/widgets/`, `lib/models/`, etc.)
- **Widget Mastery**: Proper usage of `StatelessWidget` vs. `StatefulWidget`
- **Navigation**: Implementing robust route management (`Navigator.push` and named routes)
- **State Management**: Moving from `setState` to advanced patterns (Provider/Riverpod)
- **Asynchronous Data**: Using `FutureBuilder` and `StreamBuilder` for real-time Firebase/Firestore data
- **UI/Layouts**: Mastering responsive layouts using `Row`, `Column`, `Stack`, `Expanded`, and `Flexible`
- **Theming**: Implementing consistent design using `ThemeData` and `ColorScheme`
- **Persistence**: Local data storage (e.g., using `shared_preferences` for user settings)
- **API/JSON Handling**: Parsing external JSON data into Dart models (if integrating third-party services)
